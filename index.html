        <p>The cities of Heber and Midway are two beautiful cties nestled within wasatch county. They offer close proximity <br>
        to ski resorts as well as providing many great summer activities such as mountain biking and trailrunning. In the <br>
        winter it is generally very cold with a lot of snow and in the summer it is very hot and dry. Other leisure activities  <br>
        include fishing, camping, and hiking in the wilderness that Heber and midway provide access to.</p>
